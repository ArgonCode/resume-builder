## Resume Builder
This is a ResumeBuilder.js. ResumeBuilder.js is based on Udacity's [JavaScript course](https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud804).

1. It populates data from a JSON file
2. Color scheme can be changed by editing color variables.
3. Work, Projects, Education, and Map sections can be easily swapped inside index.html, if different order is preferred.
4. Each resume section can be turned on/off independently
